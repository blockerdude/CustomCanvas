# CustomCanvas
This project is meant to give the user an easy and intuitive way to create a custom view class for android.

The custom view created will afford the user the following abilities:
    Pan and Zoom the entire custom view and everything displayed on it. 
    Create custom objects that can be placed in the custom view. 
    Detect when custom objects have been clicked regardless of current panning/zooming

More to come later
